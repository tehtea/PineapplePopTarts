Not complete yet, because some subsystems still have loose ends.

Map subsystem is buggy, will go and debug it.

Everything else is okay, and to run it, open this repository in the terminal and run `node ./Web/app.js`

On first run, remember to run `install_dependencies.sh` on Linux (master race) and `install_dependencies.bat` on Windows.
